Description:

I used pure backtracking for this sudoku puzzle. It consisted of checking if the value was in the row, column or box; If it was ot in any of those places then it was added to the box. Then  you would check if we were at our limit for column. If so, go to the next row if not go to the next column. If the number exists, make it empty again to backtrack. If it is not 0 then just proceed to the next row or column
